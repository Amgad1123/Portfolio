                             methodology. The project spanned two three-week 
                             sprints, during which we built a fully functional 
                             E-commerce store. The requirements included a 
                             login and signup system, a shopping cart, 
                             shipping functionality, 4â€“5 core features, and an
                              aesthetically pleasing user interface.

                            I worked alongside a mentor through the first year 
                            of my undergraduate degree to complete this project. 
                            I worked 10 hours a week and met once a week or as 
                            needed with my Mentor. Using several parameters,
                             the main objective was to find the relationship
                              between tweets and retweets from UNMC accounts. 
                              The parameters included using the keyword virus, 
                              over a span of one year (January 2021-January 2022),
                               and the original tweet had to come from a UNMC
                                Twitter account. 
                        </p>
                        <p class = "description-bio">For data-scraping we used a 
                            website named Sprinklr that allowed us to 
                            filter tweets based on the set parameters. 
                            Sprinklr produced the results into two CSV 
                            files (one tweet and the other retweets). 
                            The rest of the time was used to construct a 
                            data pipeline of the two CSV files into one 
                            CSV file organizing the original tweet and 
                            subtweets based on the earliest time posted. 
                            This in turn would essentially provide a chain 
                            of tweets. This was done using Python, Node.js, 
                            and frameworks including Pandas and Numpy. 
                        </p>
                        <p class = "description-bio">The finished result was an Excel
                             file that contained the chain of tweets and 
                             retweets. We extracted the location from the 
                             retweets to analyze where retweeters were from. 
                             We concluded that a majority of the retweets from 
                             UNMC accounts occur from individuals located in 
                             surrounding cities and states of Lincoln, Nebraska, 
                             with some small instances occurring in larger cities
                              such as New York and California.
